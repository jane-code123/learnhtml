        <p>
    If you’re looking for the best beaches & most vibrant waters in the Philippines, look nowhere else. 
    Balabac is worth a spot at the VERY TOP of your bucketlist.

   <br> Balabac is the southernmost group of islands in Palawan. It is so far south that Sabah, in East Malaysia is nearer 
    to Balabac than Puerto Princesa, the provincial capital of Palawan.

    <br>The main draw here are 31 gorgeous islands still vastly undiscovered by tourist crowds.
    These islands are surrounded by pristine, crystal clear waters and white sand beaches. 
    <br>Yes, the sandy shores of many beaches here are a blinding white to off-white, many even have a blushed
     pink hue! The best spots you shouldn’t miss in Balabac are (1) Onuk Island & its crystal blue waters sprawling as far as 
     the eye can see;Bugsuk Island, home to the most powdery, whitest sand beach in the Philippines; and the pink sand beach 
     at Camiaran Island.
