    <p>El Nido is the primary base for exploring Palawan’s star attraction, the stunning Bacuit Archipelago. 
        <br> Tiny swiftlets build edible nests out of saliva in the immense limestone cliffs that surround the ramshackle town proper –
         hence the name, El Nido (nest in Spanish). <br> 
        The town proper has an ordinary beach, but is home to an emerging restaurant and bar scene. 
        Brooding Cadlao Island looms just offshore.

        Many visitors prefer to stay in communities outside the town proper.
         <br> Nearby options include Corong Corong, a long, narrow beach to the south that faces Bacuit Bay; 
         or Caalan, a rocky strip of quiet resorts immediately to the north. 
         <br> Further afield, more and more resorts are sprouting along El Nido's beautiful north coastline, 
         in places like Nacpan Beach and the east coast villages of San Fernando and Sibaltan.</p>
    
    <p>Why settle for a beachfront hotel when you can stay right over the ocean in a cottage on stilts?
        <br>And why settle for any old dive site when you can snorkel in an orchid-walled lagoon?
        <br> El Nido is known as the Philippines' last frontier, and if you're looking for magnificent beaches in an unspoiled setting
        , it's a perfect place for you to vacation.</p>
