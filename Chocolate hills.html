<p>The famed Chocolate Hills of Bohol are not only two but more than 1,268 cone-shaped hills – 
    a very strange geological formation that has baffled a lot of geologists.<br> The hills are spread over an 
    area of 50 square kilometers or more and vary in size from 30 meters to 120 meters in height. <br>

    The Chocolate Hills appear to be seemingly endless when viewed atop the hill in Carmen town. <br>
    The viewing deck there gives you a 360° view of the hills “as far as the eyes can see”. <br>
    It is more majestic when viewed from a plane – them appearing to be thousands of mole hills
     dotting out from verdant surroundings.</p>

<p>The Chocolate Hills of Bohol are spread over an area covering the towns of Sagbayan, Batuan, 
    Carmen, Bilar, Sierra Bullones and Valencia. Most of the hills though are found in Sagbayan, Batuan and Carmen, 
    the later having the most uniform cone-shaped hills. <br>

    Two resorts have been developed: one in Carmen town called the Chocolate Hills Complex, and one in
     Sagbayan and known as Sagbayan Peak.<br> The oldest resort of the two is the Carmen 
    complex and is located in Barangay Buenos Aires about 5 kilometers from the town. <br>
    Carmen town is 55 kilometers from Tagbilaran City.</p>
