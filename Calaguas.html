            Mahabang Buhangin Beach in Calaguas Island is perhaps the only beach in Northern Philippines that can rival
             the likes of Boracay and the best beaches in Palawan when it comes to powdery fine white sand.<br> Despite its 
             remote location in Camarines Norte, it has risen as one of the top places to visit among beach campers 
             and adventure-seeking tourists. <br>
            The beachfront is shy of one kilometer in length and has a sprawling view of unbelievably turquoise 
            blue and crystal clear waters.
